### TFG

  This webpage allows us, using a shape, to generate a figure through C++ code that has been adapted using WebAssembly.
  
  Users have the ability to modify the figure, save it as an image, or upload/download their own shape.
  
  For modifications, users can move circles, increase the radius of these circles, or adjust the smooth factor that affects their connections with other circles. Users can also add circles, delete them, add connections, insert circles along segments, create random figures, and generate similar figures.
