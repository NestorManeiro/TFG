# TFG

Atm, we've introduced the use of d3.js and allowed the movement of circles (specific circles have been assigned a particular class: "draggable-circle", atm only wich ones with "stroke" == "black" ). 
The speed variable in the dragged function is set to 2 (subject to revision), and the recalculation is pending.
